    "# Introduction\n",
    "The goal of this study is to investigate the various factors that influence the amount of time it takes for students to earn an undergraduate degree, i.e., time-to-degree.  Clearly, there are many factors influencing time-to-degree, including a student's prior preparation, students changing majors, student employment, internships, institutional support, etc. In this notebook we investigate the influence of curricular complexity, and in particular structural complexity, on time-to-degree.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first portion of this study involves determining the impact of a program's structural complexity on a student's ability to graduate from that program within 4, 5, and 6 years. This portion of the study does *not* take into account student or institutional characteristics. This portion of the work will set the baseline for determining how additional factors influence the aforementioned graduation rates. Thus, if $X$ denotes the curricular (structural) complexity of a particular academic program, we'd like to determine its causal affect on the program's graduation rate, which can be represented as a causal diagram:\n",

Because the dependent variables are dichotomous, i.e., a student either graduates or not within a given time period, we will apply *logistic regression* in order to deal with this nonlinearity. Later we will include other independent variables related to student demographics and preparation, instructional complexity, institutional support, etc. \n",

We will use $Y=1$ is a binary outcome variable that indicates a student was able to gradaute within four years, and $Y=0$ to denote a student was *not* able to graduate within fours.

Notice also that there is a region of $x$, from about -1.5 to 1.5, that is roughly linear, and where a small change in $x$ yields a large change in $P$.  This is also the behavior we see on test data when we compare compare graduation rates to curricular complexity.  That is, there is a linear region, of intermediate curricular complexities values, where small changes in curricular complexity yeild large changes in student success (i.e., graduation rates), but at very low and very high curricular complexity values, small changes in curricular complexity produce small changes in student success. At the extremes, almost everyone graduates within four years (low curricular complexity) or almost nobody graduates within four years (high curricular complexity).\n",

    "The data that will be used to estimate these coefficients should be collected as follows. First, the analysis is backwards looking, which means the cohort should be defined as follows: Start with everyone who graduated in a given term, and then look backwards to see which first-time full-time (FTFT) cohort they belonged to. If they donâ€™t belong to a FTFT cohort, they should be excluded from the data (i.e., the analysis should focus on full-time students).

    "- **CIP:** The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code is a taxonomic coding scheme that categorizes fields of study and instructional programs. Developed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States, CIP codes are used to facilitate the organization, collection, and reporting of fields of study and program completions across all education levels. Each CIP code provides a numerical identifier assigned to a specific area of academic study, ranging from agriculture, business, and health sciences to engineering and more. These codes are essential for educational research, policy analysis, and planning, as they provide a standardized system for tracking, assessing, and comparing educational programs and their outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Program_Complexity:** This is a discrete variable reflecting the complexity of each program that students attend at a given university. The complexity metric could encompass factors like the number of required courses, the depth of course content, and the sequencing of course material.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **grad4:** A binary variable that indicates whether a student graduated within a four-year time frame (1) or took more than four years (0). This variable is essential to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of university programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **grad6:** A binary variable that indicates whether a student graduated within a six-year time frame (1) or took more than six years (0). This variable is essential to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of university programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HSGPA:** High School GPA for each student, measuring academic performance prior to university enrollment. This variable is often used in educational research to control for prior academic achievement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gender:** A binary variable (0 for male and 1 for female) representing the Gender of the student. Gender has been shown to play a role in educational outcomes and choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pell_Award:** A binary variable indicating whether a student received Pell Grant money (1) or not (0). This variable indicates students' socioeconomic status and is crucial to understanding access to educational opportunities and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Note on Sample Size.**\n",
    "It is important to collect a sufficient amount of data in order to obtain accurate estimates of the coefficietns. A discussion of sufficient sample size statistics is beyond the scope of this notebook, but as a rule of thumb, the goal should be to collect on the order of thousands of samples across a large range of programs with different curricular complexity values. In practice this typically involves collecting 6-10 terms worth of graduation data across all of the undergraduate programs at a given institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a semester-based institution, 6-10 terms corresponds to 3-5 years worth of data.  Given that programs often change their requirements over time, this introduces the problem of a program's curricular compleixty possibly changing over the data collection period. Rather than trying to track which students graduated from particular versions of a program, it may be easiest to simply average the curricular complexity scores of a program over time, and treat this as a small amount of noise in the data."

If you would like to modify any of these analyses, you may find it useful to read the toolbox documenation, as well as the curricular analytics paper listed in the References section below [2]. The curricula associated with chemcial engineering undergraduate programs at various univiersites were collected from the  http://CurricularAnalytics.org website. These curricula were entered by those working at the various institutions that provide these curricula.  We have *not* validated them in any way, i.e., we are using them \"as is\" according to how they were entered into the afforementioned web application.  That said, it is realitvely straightforward to check these curricula by visiting the websites of the various universites offering these programs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Curricular Complexity?\n",
    "The curricular complexity metrics described below were derived based upon their impact on the ability of students to progress through a curriculum. Brief details of these metrics are provided below, for the sake of completeness; however, you can skip the technical details below without loss of understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a high-level summary, we model the overall complexity of a curriculum as a function of two main components: (1) the manner in which courses in the curriculum are taught and supported, and (2) the manner in which the curriculum is structured. We refer to the former as the *instructional complexity* of the curriculum, and to the latter as the *structural complexity* of the curriculum [2]. Each of these main components are functions of numerous other curriculum-related factors. In this report we focus on the structural complexity compnents; however, if there is an interest in investigating the impact of instructional complexity on student progress, there are simulation capabilities within the CurricularAnalytics.jl toolbox that can be used for that purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "The structural complexity components we use below are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Delay Factor\n",
    "Many curricula, particularly those in science, technology engineering and math (STEM) fields, contain a set of courses that must be completed in sequential order. It is not uncommon in these programs to find prerequisite pathways consisting of seven or eight coursesâ€”they span nearly every term in any possible degree plan. The ability to successfully navigate these long pathways without delay is critical for student success and on-time graduation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any curriculum $c$ we can construct a *curriculum graph*, denoted $G_c = (V,E)$, that is determined by the prerequisites in the curriculum. Specifially, each vertex $v_1, . . . , v_n âˆˆ V$ represents a required course course in curriculum $c$. There is a directed edge $(v_i,v_j) âˆˆ E$ from course $v_i$ to $v_j$ if $v_i$ is a prerequisite of $v_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based up this definition, we define the **delay factor** associated with a given course $v_k$ in a curriculum $c$, denoted $d_c(v_k)$, as the number of vertices in the longest path in $G_c$ that passes through $v_k$. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Blocking Factor\n",
    "Another structural factor arises when one course serves as the gateway to many other courses in the curriculum. In this case, if a student is unable to pass the gateway course, they are **blocked** from attempting many of the other courses in the curriculum.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, *Calculus 1* is often a foundational first-term course in a STEM curriculum that must be completed before taking other major-specific classes in subsequent terms. It is obvious that a course which is a prerequisite for a large number of other courses in a curriculum is a highly important course in that curriculum.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Structural Complexity\n",
    "After computing the blocking and delay factors for a curriculum, a unitless measure for structural complexity can be computed for any curriculum. Keep in mind that structural complexity explicitly relates to the likelihood that a student can complete a curriculum, as well be demonstrated below..\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Causal inference is a statistical approach that aims to determine the cause-and-effect relationship between variables. Unlike traditional correlation analysis, which can only identify associations between variables, causal inference seeks to uncover how changes in one variable directly affect another. This distinction is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive observed outcomes, enabling researchers and decision-makers to predict the consequences of interventions accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal inference is important for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decision Making**: It allows policymakers, scientists, and businesses to make informed decisions by understanding the likely impact of their actions. For instance, in public health, knowing the causal relationship between lifestyle choices and health outcomes can inform effective prevention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Understanding Complex Systems**: Many systems, such as economic markets, ecosystems, and human biology, are complex and interrelated. Causal inference helps disentangle these relationships, providing insights into how system components interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Policy Evaluation**: It is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of policies and interventions. By identifying causal effects, it becomes possible to assess whether a policy achieved its intended outcomes and to optimize future interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoiding Spurious Correlations**: Not all associations imply causation. Causal inference techniques help distinguish between mere correlations, which might be coincidental or due to confounding factors, and genuine causal relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Innovation and Development**: In fields like drug development and technology, understanding causality can lead to breakthroughs by identifying which factors most significantly influence desired outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on causality rather than correlation, causal inference provides a more profound and actionable understanding of the world, enabling more effective interventions and smarter decision-making across a wide range of disciplines."
